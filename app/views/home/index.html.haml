    %h4 What is Infiltration?
    %p
      Play a game where all maps are created by the community. Would you be able to beat your friends's maps?
    %p
      Design and create your own maps. It is easy and fun with our WYSIWYG map editor.
    %p
      Do you have what it takes to be a map designer master?

    %h4 The Rankings
    %p
      Infiltration is PvM (player versus map). This is a new concept, since both players and maps have a score.
    %p
      Everytime you beat a map, you gain ranking score, and the map loses ranking score. But if you lose, the map will take the score from you.
    %p
      The score calculation is done using the ELO rating system, in a similar way to chess tournaments. This means that if you can create a map that is very difficult to beat, it will eventually get a better score. Also, the system will be able to offer you maps that are of your current player level.


    %h4 Just a Prototype
    %p
      This is a proof of concept. You should expect bugs and security flaws. Our goal is to try the concept of PvM and automatically ranked user generated content. Please, tell us what you feel in the blog.
    %p
      Good luck and have fun!
