    %h4 Players vs Challenges
    %p
      In the Jumpcraft universe, players beat challenges created by other players.
      Who are the best players? Who can build the hardest challenges? Roll yourself in the seek for perfection,

    %h4 Build Challenges
    %p
      All challenges are created by other players, with the exception of a few introductory trials. Jumpcraft is not only about playing challenges, but also about building challenges.

    %h4 Rankings and Rating System
    %p
      Both players and challenges can level up and down. Every ranked game will update both player and challenge levels, making not only a competitive ranking for players but also for challenges. This also helps the system to suggest challenges that are of the appropriate difficulty level.
    %p
      After each ranked game, the player and challenge level update is done using the [Microsoft's Trueskill Rating System](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/trueskill/).


    %h4 Just a Prototype
    %p
      Jumpcraft is a proof of concept. You should not expect full functionality. Our goal is to build a small prototype to try out automatically ranked user generated content, and well, also have some fun building a decent 2D platformer system.

      Good luck and have fun!
