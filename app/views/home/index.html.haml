      %h4 Jumpcraft is Player vs Challenge
      %p
        In the Jumpcraft universe, players beat challenges created by other players.
        You can create your own challenges for other people to play against.

      %h4 Rankings and Rating System
      %p
        Both players and challenges can level up and down.
        Every ranked game will update both player and challenge levels, making not only a competitive ranking for players but also for challenges.
        This also helps the system to suggest challenges that are of the appropriate difficulty level.
      %p
        After each ranked game, the player and challenge level update is done using the Trueskill Rating System.
