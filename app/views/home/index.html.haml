  %h4 What is Infiltration?
  %p
    Infiltration is a 2D platformer where all maps are created by the comunity.

  %p
    With a competitive ranking, every game counts to get a better score to be the king of the ladder.

  %p
    Creating maps is easy and fun. The maps will also get ranked against other maps, based on their dificulty. But remember that creators have to defeat their own maps before being able to submit them to the ladder.

  %p
    Good luck and have fun!
